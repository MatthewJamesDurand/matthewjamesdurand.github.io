## Who am I?

My name is Matthew, I'm a 24 year old Junior Data Analyst living in the city of Lyon, France. I am currently studying at Wild Code School until August 2022, but I also enjoy using my free time to explore the data world.

My background is quite diverse. When I was 16 studied airline operations and moved buisness and management in tourism in the UK, before moving back to France and pursuing my passion for technology. I studied web development at Epitech, and discovered SQL, which lead me to where I am now: Data Analysis.

In my free time, I like to compete in and organise e-sports events. For the past 3 years I have been a tournament organiser for [Super Smash Bros. Melee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee) events here in France, most commonly in Lyon, welcoming hundreds of players across Europe and the United States.

On this website you can find links to my CV, my contact information and a portfolio of some of my projects, which I will aim to expand in the future.
